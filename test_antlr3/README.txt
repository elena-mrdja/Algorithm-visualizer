This folder was a first successful tryout of the ANTLR library that I have managed to do. All the work that has been done while working on the things that are 
included here, will be used for the final product.

SETUP:
  1) Download the files
  2) In the Terminal direct yourself into build folder
  3) Call: cmake ../
  4) Call: make
  5) Now your project is configurated and you can open it in QT (use CMakeLists.txt file to configurate QT project)
 
Now when all is set up, open the main.cpp file and if you run it will lexer and parser, creating a parse tree as the final project, the and_keyword.cpp.
