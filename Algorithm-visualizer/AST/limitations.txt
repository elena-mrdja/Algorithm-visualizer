WHAT WE CAN USE :

We can run our program on the main function, which shouldn’t call any other functions.

Structure:
-	Main function
-	While loop
-	If/Else

Statements:
-	Return 
-	Print (equivalent to std∷cout ≪ “thing to be printed” ≪ std∷endl; )
-	Jump

Binary Operations (BinOp):
-	+   
-	-     
-	*       
-	/      
-	%       
-	||       
-	&&      
-	==    
-	!=     
-	<      
-	<=     
-	>     
-	>= 

Unop:
-	++
-	--

Variables:
-	Boolean
-	Double (positive or negative)
-	Integer (positive or negative)

WHAT WE CANNOT USE : 

Structure:
-	For loop
-	Inner functions/Recursions
-	Classes
-	Do ... while (we should use only while instead)
- Other functions that are not main functions

Variable:
-	String 
-	Array (only done for back-end)
 
BinOp:
-	Shortcuts, such as   -=    +=    /=    *=

Initialize variable without assigning something to it
int number ; //not possible
int number = 3 ; //possible
