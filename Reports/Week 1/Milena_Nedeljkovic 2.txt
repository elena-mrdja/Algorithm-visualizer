As the leader of Team 2, this week I worked on establishing good communication with the other leaders and making sure that me and my team have a good idea of what our task is.
With established basic grammar and tokens, we decided to start by making a hyperclass to be able to store the tokens in lists. The two main classes will be for expressions and statements, which will be the parents of all other classes.
For the meeting on Monday, we plan to make a list of the classes we need and assign them to each of the four of us to work on for the rest of the week, along with more research.
