During this week our team has started on researching about how to tokenize input and how to process it in the way that the output will be useful for AST team. 
We have found two libraries that work on tokenizing algebraic expressions (which functionality is not enough to implement our goals but we will use it as an example 
and further developments). After few meetings with other subteam leaders, we have come to a decision that we will not be using the libraries we found themselves but 
we will rewrite them in the way that would be easier for an AST team to use and so that all of us properly understand what each line of the code does. Obviously we 
will be basing our knowledges on resources we found but we will simplify them and make them more useful for our project. During the next week I will split the tasks 
(i.e split classes to do) between our subteam members and we will try to implement the majority of the basic operations. As a project team we have already defined 
tokens and grammar we want to use.
