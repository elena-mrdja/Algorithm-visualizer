During the first week, we have spent a lot of time setting up the efficient workflows for the upcoming weeks and planning on how to carry out the project.
We set our minimal and basic goals and discussed about additional features we would implement. 
Sub-team leaders spent time in their respective teams, planning how they would approach the tasks and delegating various assignments to team members.
Individually, team members spent time getting familiar with the process of lexing, parsing and creating the AST as it is a new notion for all of us. 

Parsing team found the library that will help us tokenize the input code and the AST team defined the classes hierarchy for the grammar we will use.
We have made a list of tokens we will use (both for basic goal and additional features) and defined the grammar. 
GUI team is learning QT graphics.
