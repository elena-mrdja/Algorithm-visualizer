# Week 2 - Reports

#### Elena Mrdja
This week I worked on grasping all the necessary knowledge in Qt graphics we will need. As planned, I finished the Qt Graphics course we found, and I implemented the gathered skills through making a trial project where I created a main window with different shapes and their class methods, which will be of great help as I progress with coding the project.

After everyone in GUI team was done with the course, I set up a meeting to decide on all the custom classes and the shape types we want to have in our project. When this was decided, I started coding the main window of our project's GUI, adding the classes and creating a simple structure we plan to build upon next week. Next week our goal is to finish the text editor cell and implement all the shapes we decided to use.

As the git leader, I created a tutorial document with all of the important git hub commands, so that everyone was sure on how to use it, and was there to help my teammates out with any git hub problems.

This week was dedicated to research. Since this is a complex project, where we need to build a parser and interpreter and learn about multiple libraries and complex data structures, it is very important for everyone to take some time to study and understand the main principles. I had 3 jobs this week: research a parses, research the antlr library, and research parser trees. 

The first resource I studied was a 19-part article “Let’s build an Interpreter”, which walks you through parsing, tokenising, grammars, parser trees and ASTs. I have completed 8/19 parts, so my goal is to finish this series by Tuesday.

I also browsed the ANTLR documentation, and looked at some functions that specifically deal with parser trees. 
The next step is to start building the AST classes and methods with the rest of my team.

This week, I deepened my knowledge in ANTLR and tokenization by doing some research on internet. I defined more in details the grammar and I started to code the first token. Next week, I will try to finish to code the first 2 tokens.

This week I worked on the implementation of tests to understand and verify that our library works. This also allows us to check the different functionalities of the library and what it returns. I created different tests of different complexity. The goal is to have the library 100% functional by the end of the week.
